    "On Saturday, more than a hundred residents gathered at Greenlake Park in Riverton for a memorial honouring a longtime neighborhood volunteer who died earlier this month.",
    "Friends and family shared brief remarks about her work organizing food drives and mentoring teens; the service concluded with a quiet walk past a small floral tribute near the park’s south entrance.",
    "Organizers from the Oak Street Community Center said the event was intended “simply to give neighbors a place to grieve together.” Attendees observed a moment of silence, and volunteers collected donations for the center’s youth programs. City officials said a plaque will be installed next month to recognize her service."
